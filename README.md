# React Micro Frontend Template

## Getting Started

Run the script to initialize the project and install dependencies:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

> Maintain consistency for the project name (all micro service and root project should have the same project name)
> Give the micro frontend a name
> Setup the HTML element where you want to inject your micro frontend
